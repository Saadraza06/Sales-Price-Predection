# 🧠 Sales-Price-Predection
This project aims to predict future sales prices (e.g. real estate or product pricing) using Sales data and machine learning. The trained model predicts prices based on multiple features and can be accessed via a Jupyter notebook or CLI application.
# 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
• Python (3.x)

• Pandas, NumPy 

• scikit-learn – regression algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest

• Jupyter Notebook 

• Matplotlib, Seaborn
#  🔍 Insights
• Sale price is strongly influenced by features like location, size, and overall quality.

• Removing outliers and handling missing data improved model accuracy.

• Feature engineering (e.g., total area, property age) boosted performance.

• Tree-based models (like XGBoost, Random Forest) outperformed linear models.

• Proper encoding of categorical data was crucial for accurate predictions.

• RMSE and R² scores were used to evaluate model performance effectively.
